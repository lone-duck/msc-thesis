\chapter{Preface}
This thesis contains original research conducted by Dylan Green under the supervision of Dr.\ Frank Wood and Dr.\ Berend Zwartsenberg, with input from collaborators William Harvey and Saeid Naderiparizi. The idea to use video diffusion models for video inpainting was proposed by F.\ Wood, and further developed by D.\ Green. The design and implementation of the method, the construction of the datasets, and the design of the experiments were all completed by D.\ Green. The sampling schemes introduced in \cref{sec:samplingschemes} were developed and implemented collaboratively by D.\ Green, W. Harvey and S. Naderiparizi. 

The work presented in this thesis is currently under review at the European 
Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV). Significant portions of the thesis have been adapted from our ECCV submission.
