\chapter{Limitations}
The most notable limitation of our method is its computational cost relative to competing methods. The wall-clock time for our method is highly dependent on a number of factors, such as the number of sampler steps used and the number of frames generated in each stage of the sampling scheme used. Improvements in few-step generation for diffusion models and increasing the size of our model such that more frames can be processed at a time would both help to mitigate these concerns. Additionally, our method requires that a model be trained on a specific dataset which is reasonably close to the data distribution to be inpainted at test time, requiring large datasets. The development of large scale, general purpose video generative models would likely help to make generative approaches such as ours more robust to out-of-distribution tasks.
