\chapter{Potential Negative Impacts}
The development of generative models for the generation of photo-realistic video opens the door to malicious or otherwise unethical uses which could have negative impacts on society. While our method is currently limited to operating on data which is sufficiently similar to the datasets it was trained on, and those datasets have limited potential for malicious use, future work which takes a generative approach to video inpainting could be used for the purposes of misinformation, harassment or deception.
