\chapter{Diffusion Model Sampling Details}
As alluded to in the main paper, we train a diffusion model that uses $\epsilon$-prediction to parameterize the score of a distribution over $\bx_t$ at each time $t$. This can be used to parameterize a stochastic differential equation (or ordinary differential equation) that morphs samples from a unit Gaussian into approximate samples from the conditional distribution of interest $p_\theta(\bx_0|\by)$ \citep{song2020score}. We use the Heun sampler proposed by \citet{karras2022elucidating} to integrate this SDE. Our hyperparameters are $\sigma_\text{max}=1000$, $\sigma_\text{min} = 0.002$, $\rho=7$, $S_\text{churn}=80$, $S_\text{max}=\infty$, $S_0=0$, and $S_\text{noise}=1$. We use 100 sampling steps (involving 199 network function evaluations) for each experiment except where specified otherwise.
