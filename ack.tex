\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank my supervisors Frank Wood and Mark Schmidt: Frank for his relentless encouragement and enthusiasm, and Mark for his support through numerous life challenges and for inspiring me to pursue machine learning. I would also like to thank Berend Zwartsenberg, Will Harvey, Saeid Naderiparizi, and Matt Niedoba for their contributions to the work presented in this thesis.

I am very grateful to the friends I have made in X568: Frederik Kunstner, Wilder Lavington, Betty Shea, Si Yi (Cathy) Meng, Helen Zhang, Alan Milligan, Aaron Mishkin, Victor Portella, Greg d'Eon, Curtis Fox, and too many more to name. The past few years would have been much tougher were it not for your friendship. 

I would like to thank my family (both chosen and blood) for their support and encouragement over the years, without which I would not be here. A very special thanks is owed to my aunt, Janet Green, for her financial contributions to my education. 

Lastly, I would like to thank my fianc√©e Sara Clouston for putting up with me for all these years, for inspiring me, and for always being there. And a very special thanks to Arlo and Isla for keeping me sane. And thanks, I guess, to Alba too.
